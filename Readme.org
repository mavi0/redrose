#+title: Redrose

This is a beamer-org theme I use for power-points whilst teaching as a TA/Society/AL at the University of Lancaster.

* How to use
Clone this repo into your beamer file, and you can probably figure out the rest. If anyone else ever uses this I'll probably write a nicer How to for it.

* Usecase
This is use-case targeted for teaching computer science. Mathematicians are welcome to use it. But I don't plan on explicitly supporting this style of usage, so please don't open PR about these sort of issues.
