This is a $\LaTeX$ theme that can be used to generate nice-ish looking pdfs.

* Supported Styles
There are currently one supported styles:
- SCC (School of Computing and Communications) // Via provision (will add branding at a later date)
The following styles are in development:
- Maths (Eventually)

* How to!
Clone this repo into your src_bash{} file, and you can probably figure out the rest. If anyone else ever uses this I'll probably write a nicer "How to" for this.
