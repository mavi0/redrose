redrose is a $\LaTeX$ theme that can be used to generate nice-ish looking pdfs, that are colour co-ordinated to the University of Lancaster's colours.

There are currently one supported styles:
- SCC (School of Computing and Communications) // Via provision (will add branding at a later date)
The following styles are in development:
- Maths (Eventually)

* How to!
Clone this repo into your tex file, and you can probably figure out the rest via looking at the examples. If anyone else ever uses this I'll probably write a nicer "How to" for this.
