#+title: Redrose

This is a beamer-org theme I use for power-points whilst teaching as a TA/Society/AL at the University of Lancaster.

* TODO LIST HERE
- [ ] Implement Coding Lsp integration
- [ ] Implement Control Theory Diagrams
- [ ] Implement UML diagrams

* Supported Styles
There are currently two supported styles:
- CompSoc
- SCC
The following styles are in development:
- None

* How to use
Clone this repo into your beamer file, and you can probably figure out the rest. If anyone else ever uses this I'll probably write a nicer How to for it.

If you're using this with org. I use doom and that is the only version that I'm planning on 'supporting' right now.

* Usecase
This is use-case targeted for teaching computer science. Mathematicians are welcome to use it. But I don't plan on explicitly supporting this style of usage, so please don't open an issue about some random quirky maths display issue that is only relevant in a specific 400 module.
